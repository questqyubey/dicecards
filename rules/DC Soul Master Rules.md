## Dice Cards Soul Master Rules

The following are extra rules for expanding duel and narrative play.

## Attributes

**Soul Cards:** Special units with extra abilities. A deck can have 1 per archetype. They can be summoned as a soul unit by spending a die value equal to their soul value (1-6) as part of their summon cost. A soul card has 3 extra abilities (4th, 5th, 6th), in addition to their base archetype. Only one unit per soul card can be active on the field at a time.

**Rarity:** Abilities are rated Common, Uncommon, and Rare according to the effects that they have.

**Tribes:** Archetypes have one of five tribes: Dark, Wild, Terra, Justice, Machine. Effects may target units and tokens with these tribes.

## Summon Keywords

These keywords modify the units produced by an archetype. Archetypes can have multiple special keyword abilities, detailed below.

üó°Ô∏è
**Ritual:** An ability containing the Ritual keyword. They allow the use of more powerful passive effects. To summon a Ritual unit, all ritual costs must be paid.

üß¨
**Fusion:** An ability containing the Fusion keyword. They allow the use of more powerful units. To summon a Fusion unit, units from specified archetypes must be sacrificed. Units paid as part of the cost add their power and equip tokens to the new unit.

- If soul unit/s are paid as part of the cost, the new unit inherits 1 of their soul cards. If the Fusion ability itself is part of a soul card (not base archetype), the new unit always uses that soul card.

‚õ∞Ô∏è
**Realm:** An ability containing the Realm keyword. They allow the use of powerful, field-wide abilities. Instead of setting a unit, set a field token with Hexproof and value set to the Realm ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Realm abilities can only be activated by a Realm token with their value. They are placed in their owner's token zone but their abilities may affect the entire field.

üíç
**Relic:** An ability containing the Relic keyword. They allow the use of powerful unit-specific effects. Instead of setting a unit, set an equip token with Persistent and value set to the Relic ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Relic abilities can only be activated by a Relic token with their value. The token can be re-equipped once per turn to any unit.

**Multiple:** If an archetype has multiple special keywords, all of their costs must be met to summon them and the conditions are cumulative. Fusion and Ritual abilities can be cast if you control a Relic or Realm token for the archetype. Casting Relic or Realm abilities require you to control a token that references the ability. If an archetype has a Relic or Realm ability, they are always set instead of a unit. If an archetype has both, either may be summoned by choice.

## Formats

**Drafting:** Players construct decks of up to 3 archetypes with 3 abilities each (9 total), from randomized sets. There should be at least 3 sets per player. Each pack should include 3 Common abilities, 2 Uncommon abilities, and 1 Rare ability. Players take turns to choose one ability from their sets, and then pass the remainder to the next player.

- If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it one ability from the pack.

**Campaign:** Players construct their own decks through dueling and deckbuilding. Abilities are earnt from winning duels or bought from a store. Abilities can be bought and sold by rarity: Common $1, Uncommon $2, Rare $5. A pack of 3 random abilities can be bought for $5 (limit 1 rare per pack). Abilities can be used to create a new archetype or added to an existing archetype. Abilities cannot be switched between archetypes once assigned and can only be removed by selling them. Archetypes can be combined if they share the same Tribe, but must discard down to 3 abilities. Players start with $5.

- If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it one ability from the pack. Abilities can be added to Soul Cards as per archetypes. Once a Soul Card is added to an archetype, it cannot change archetype. It will inherit the new archetype when combining.

- **Optional:** Soul Cards ability slots are unlocked by summoning them in duels. 1st slot is unlocked after 2 duels, 2nd after 4 duels, and 3rd after 6 duels. Duel count may be substituted by narrative events, if applicable.

**Dungeon-Crawl:** Each player is represented by a 1-power 'Duelist' unit with no archetype that acts like a player. Duelists start with a stock (24), grave (0), and shield dice (3). They can be declared for battle during the battle phase, and all damage and effects are re-targeted to the outermost shield first. Abilities and damage may bypass shields if the duelist allows it. Duelists are defeated when they reach 0 stock or they are destroyed. Duelists start play with a draw phase but skip all other draw phases. Instead, they gain a draw phase for their next turn for each controller they defeat, or by finding a Draw point.

A controller is a unit or group of units that acts like a player. They have no stock, grave, or shield, but may control other units and tokens, and activate abilities. They may be encountered during play and defeated to gain a draw phase. Soul units and other unique units can be 'Duelist' units like the player is, and have their own stock, grave, and shields. When defeated, they may be claimed by the victor and added to their deck.

The game space is made up of Fields. Each duel takes place in a field, and units can use the battle phase on their turn to declare movement between fields instead of battling. Movement is resolved at the end of each turn. When opposed controllers occupy the same field, they must duel. Once all opposed units have been removed from the field (fled or destroyed), the opposed controller is defeated and the duel ends. A controller provides no draw phase for being defeated more than once in the same run (if they flee and are encountered again).

Field tokens remain on the field they are summoned to, and equip tokens move with the unit they are attached to. Tokens with no controller may be claimed by any controller during their turn. Fields may contain enemy controllers, neutral or friendly controllers, draw points, and pre-existing field and equip tokens.

**Roguelike Run**: TBD

## Quest-Specific

Shorthand for Power is P and Energy Token is E (2P Soldier, single-1E).

**Turn Options:** Place any costs in [] brackets. Votes are given in format of: _Source effect target [cost]_

- "2P Soldier uses Destroy on 3P Dragon [double-2E]"
- "Destroy 3P Dragon [double-2E]" if the source isn't needed
- "2P Soldier +1 Power [single-5E]" if the target isn't needed.
