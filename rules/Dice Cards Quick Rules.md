Concepts
Theory: This game is designed to evoke the feeling of TCG games like “Magic The Gathering” and “YuGiOh!” using a dice-based system. Players take turns to draw & roll dice, summon units, and battle each other. The first player to be damaged directly, or to start their turn with no dice in stock, loses the game.
Preparation: Each player needs 27 dice in 1-4 colours (at least 9 white, recomm. 6 for each colour), and chooses up to 9 abilities for their deck, to be split into 3 'archetypes' each with a unique colour. An archetype’s colour indicates which units and tokens belong to it. White dice indicate typeless units and tokens.
Dice and Units: Dice are your resources and your units. In the hand, they can be spent to summon units and charge energy. On the field, they represent units and tokens. You start with 24 in stock to draw from and 3 'shield' dice to protect you. Once a die is spent or a unit destroyed, it is discarded.
Placing Dice: If an ability or an action requires dice to be placed, use dice that were discarded as part of the cost. Otherwise, take dice from the player's stock. You can swap out dice of the appropriate colour from the grave or stock as needed but keep the same total count.
Discard/Banish: When dice are discarded, add them to the player's grave. When dice are banished, they are removed from play.
Numbers: All fractions are rounded up.

Elements of Play
Stock: A pool of 24 dice that players can draw from. If a player starts their turn with 0 dice in stock, they lose. Dice in the stock are typeless.
Hand: A private pool of dice, drawn from the stock. Each die has a value which is rolled when drawn. They are spent to summon units or charge energy tokens. Players discard down to 6 dice during the End Phase. Dice in the hand are typeless.
Grave: A pool of dice that have been spent or discarded. Dice in the grave are typeless.
Units: Placed by summoning a hand die for half its value. A player can have up to 5 units on their field. Each unit has a Power rating, indicated by the value of its die, and an Archetype, indicated by the die's colour. For units with >6 power, stack up to 3 dice with 6 power each (18 power max). If a unit would be placed when a player already has 5 on their field, discard it.
When units battle they deal their power in damage to each other simultaneously. Damage does not reduce a unit’s power. If the damage dealt to a unit during a single turn is equal to or greater than their power, they are destroyed. If a unit is ever reduced to 0 power, they are destroyed and their dice discarded.
Energy Tokens: Placed by charging a hand die for its full value. Sets of matching values can be spent to activate unit abilities. Energy tokens are typeless. After energy tokens are spent, discard them.
Shields: Each player has 3 Shield Dice, valued at 2, 4, and 6 (outer to inner). A player cannot be targeted while they have shields, and only the outermost shield can be targeted. Shield dice are typeless and cannot attack. Damage dealt to a Shield reduces its power, and at 0 power it is destroyed. Destroyed shield dice are rolled and added to the player's hand. When the player has no more shields, they can be targeted directly.
Abilities: Archetypes have abilities and units can activate them during a Main Phase by paying their cost. 'Single', a single energy token; 'Double', two matching energy tokens; 'Triple', three matching energies; 'Low', energy token with 1, 2 or 3; 'High' energy token with 4, 5, or 6. Once paid, the effect activates and targets may be selected.
Other Tokens: Tokens are represented by dice. A token's archetype is indicated by its die colour and the die's value corresponds to the ability used to create them (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Equip tokens affect units they are equipped to, and are placed to the left and right of the unit (max 2 per unit). Field tokens affect the whole field, and are placed to the far left of all units. When a unit is destroyed, their equip tokens are destroyed too. An equip token shares the same controller as its attached unit. Otherwise, tokens are controlled by their original player (owner).

Turn Structure
Turn Phases: Players take turns in the duel, and the challenged player always goes first. The turns progress as follows:
•	Draw Phase
•	Main Phase 1
•	Battle Phase
•	Main Phase 2
•	End Phase
The player to go first skips their first Battle Phase. The player to go second draws +1 dice on their first turn.
Draw Phase: The player draws 3 dice from the stock, rolls them, and adds them to their hand. Keep the values hidden.
Main Phases: Hand dice can be used to summon units (power = half die value, archetype = 1 from deck), or charged as energy tokens (full die value). Energy can be spent to activate abilities. Each turn, players have 1 summon action and 2 charge actions.
Battle Phase: The player can declare their units as attackers, then the opponent declares units as defenders. The defender chooses the order of battles with units, and the attacker chooses the order of battles with shields. Each defender can only block one attacker, but multiple defenders may block the same attacker. If an attacker isn't defended against, it attacks the opponent's shields, or the opponent directly if there are no shields.
End Phase: Discard down to 6 hand dice and resolve end-of-turn effects.


Devious Dice Duels Keyword References
 
Banish: Remove dice from play. If the target is a unit or token, destroy it and remove their dice.
Capture: A unit (captive) is positioned behind another unit (captor). The captive unit cannot be declared for battle but still activate abilities and be targeted. If the captor is removed from the field, the capture ends. A unit can only capture one unit at a time.
Charge: Set an energy token on the field with a value equal to the die spent.
Cleave X: When the unit battles, it may target up to X units and battle each, with an attack for each battle.
Controller: The player currently controlling the unit or token.
Copy: The unit may pay for and activate an ability they don't have.
Deadly: After a unit deals damage in battle, the target unit is destroyed.
Defender: The unit cannot attack or be declared as an attacker, but reduces all damage recieved by half. Reduction occurs after any abilities resolve.
Destroy: A unit is destroyed when it has 0 power or recieves damage equal to its power. Its dice are discarded.
Discard: Move dice to the grave.
Double-Strike: After the unit attacks in battle, it may attack again. The target unit does not counter unless they also have multiple attacks.
Drain: Reduce a unit's power and add power to another unit. Draining attacks use the attacking unit's power and add half the power drained. They do not deal damage.
Draw: Take dice from the stock, roll their values, and add them to the hand.
Equip: Place an equip token with a unit. The token's effects end if the unit is removed from the field or the equip token is removed from the unit. A player may equip each token they control without a unit up to once per turn.
Evade: The unit or token is removed from the field (not destroyed) and returns to the field under its owner's control at the end of the turn.
Fading: The unit reduces its power by 1 at the start of its controller's turn.
Frozen: The unit or token cannot change its power or archetype.
Fusion (Summon): Sacrifices must be paid to summon the unit, detailed after the keyword. Capitalized words in the cost refer to a specific archetype. Any units sacrificed add their power and equip tokens to the summoned unit.
Haste: The unit's attack is resolved first. If they destroy the target of battle, they are not attacked by the enemy. Multiple attacks are still resolved after the defender attacks.
Hexproof: The unit cannot be directly targeted by abilities. It can still be affected by abilities that do not target specific units.
Indestructible: The unit or token cannot be destroyed. If it would be reduced to 0 power, it is instead reduced to 1 power.
Instant: The ability can be activated during any player's battle phase, before and after declaring units.
Negate: Do not resolve the effects of the event specified (ability effect, ability cost, battle, damage, etc). Event still occurs for triggered ability (when / activated) purposes.
Owner: The original player that summoned the unit or token.
Paralyzed: The unit cannot battle or activate abilities.
Persistent: The equip token is not destroyed when its unit is, and may be re-equipped once during any of the owner’s main phases.
Piercing: If damage is dealt in excess of a unit's power, the remainder is dealt to the controller's shield dice. Damage continues to pierce each shield die and then the controller.
Realm (Summon): Instead of setting a unit, set a Realm field token with Hexproof. The controller can cast abilities from the Realm's archetype. Each Realm ability needs its own token.
Reinforce: When the unit deals attack damage, add +1 shield power to the controller's outer-most shield die. Effect is ignored if the die is already 6.
Relic (Summon): Instead of setting a unit, set a Relic equip token with Persistent. The controller can cast abilities from the Relic's archetype and any effects that target 'this' target the equipped unit instead. Each Relic ability needs its own token.
Reroll: Dice values are rerolled, usually in the hand.
Retarget: New target/s are selected for an ability and it affects them instead. Targets must be valid for the ability.
Return: The unit is removed from the field (not destroyed) permanently. The unit's owner adds 1 die from the unit to their hand and rolls it, then discards the rest.
Ritual (Summon): Additional costs must be paid to summon the unit, detailed after the keyword. Capitalized words in the cost refer to a specific archetype.
Sacrifice: Destroy targeted unit as part of an ability cost. Attributes of the unit may be used for the ability effect (power, tokens, type).
Scry X: Pre-roll the next X dice to be drawn from the stock. The values should be kept secret.
Set: Set a die on the field as a unit with the power and archetype specified. If the archetype has Ritual abilities (see Ritual), pay the additional cost before setting or else ignore the set action. If an archetype is not specified, select one from your deck.
Stackable: The token's effects can be stacked. Equip tokens are limited to three in a single equip slot.
Stealthy: The unit can't be targeted for battle or with abilities from a unit with greater power than it.
Summon: Spend a die from your hand to perform a Set action, with power equal to half the value of the die spent and an archetype from your deck.
Target: The target of the ability. If no conditions are specified, target can be any valid option controlled by any player.
Unblockable: The unit can't be targeted for battle by defenders. It can still enter battle with abilities or by being a defender.
Withering: Any damage the unit recieves instead reduces its power by an equal amount. The unit does not recieve damage.


Devious Dice Duels Extra Rules

The following are extra rules for expanding duel and narrative play.

Soul Cards: Special units with extra abilities. A deck can have 1 per archetype. They can be summoned as a soul unit by spending a die value equal to their soul value (1-6) as part of their summon cost. A soul card has 3 extra abilities (token ref: 4, 5, 6), in addition to their base archetype. Only one unit per soul card can be active on the field at a time.
Rarity: Abilities are rated Common, Uncommon, and Rare according to how many effects they have. 1-2 effects: Common, 3 effects: Uncommon, 4 or more: Rare.
Tribes: Archetypes have one of five tribes: Dark, Wild, Terra, Justice, Machine. Effects may target units and tokens with these tribes.

Special Keywords: These keywords modify the units produced by an archetype. Archetypes can have multiple special keyword abilities, detailed below.
Ritual: An ability containing the Ritual keyword. They allow the use of more powerful passive effects. To summon a Ritual unit, all ritual costs must be paid.
Fusion: An ability containing the Fusion keyword. They allow the use of more powerful units. To summon a Fusion unit, all fusion costs must be paid. Units paid as part of the cost add their power and equip tokens to the new unit. If soul unit/s are paid as part of the cost, the new unit inherits 1 of their soul cards. If the Fusion ability itself is part of a soul card (not base archetype), the new unit always uses that soul card.
Realm: An ability containing the Realm keyword. They allow the use of powerful, field-wide abilities. Instead of setting a unit, set a field token with value set to the Realm ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Realm abilities can only be activated by a Realm token with their value.
Relic: An ability containing the Relic keyword. They allow the use of powerful unit-specific effects. Instead of setting a unit, set an equip token with Persistent and value set to the Relic ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Relic abilities can only be activated by a Relic token with their value. The token can be re-equipped once per turn to any unit.
Multiple: If an archetype has multiple special keywords, all of their costs must be met to summon them and the conditions are cumulative. Fusion and Ritual abilities can be cast if you control a Relic or Realm token for the archetype. Casting Relic or Realm abilities require you to control a token that references the ability. If an archetype has a Relic or Realm ability, they are always set instead of a unit. If an archetype has both, either may be summoned by choice.

Drafting: Players construct decks of up to 3 archetypes with 3 abilities each (9 total), from randomized sets. There should be at least 3 sets per player. Each pack should include 3 Common abilities, 2 Uncommon abilities, and 1 Rare ability. Players take turns to choose one ability from their sets, and then pass the remainder to the next player.
If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it one ability from the pack.

Campaign: Players construct their own decks through dueling and deckbuilding. Abilities are earnt from winning duels or bought from a store. Abilities can be bought and sold by rarity: Common $1, Uncommon $2, Rare $5. A pack of 3 random abilities can be bought for $5 (limit 1 rare per pack). Abilities can be used to create a new archetype or added to an existing archetype. Abilities cannot be switched between archetypes once assigned and can only be removed by selling them. Archetypes can be combined if they share the same Tribe, but must discard down to 3 abilities. Players start with $5.
If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it one ability from the pack. Abilities can be added to Soul Cards as per archetypes. Once a Soul Card is added to an archetype, it cannot change archetype. It will inherit the new archetype when combining.
Optional: Soul Cards ability slots are unlocked by summoning them in duels. 1st slot is unlocked after 2 duels, 2nd after 4 duels, and 3rd after 6 duels. Duel count may be substituted by narrative events, if applicable.

Dungeon-Crawl: Each player is represented by a 1-power 'Duelist' unit with no archetype that acts like a player. Duelists start with a stock (24), grave (0), and shield dice (3). They can be declared for battle during the battle phase, and all damage and effects are re-targeted to the outermost shield first. Abilities and damage may bypass shields if the duelist allows it. Duelists are defeated when they reach 0 stock or they are destroyed. Duelists start play with a draw phase but skip all other draw phases. Instead, they gain a draw phase for their next turn for each controller they defeat, or by finding a Draw point.
A controller is a unit or group of units that acts like a player. They have no stock, grave, or shield, but may control other units and tokens, and activate abilities. They may be encountered during play and defeated to gain a draw phase. Soul units and other unique units can be 'Duelist' units like the player is, and have their own stock, grave, and shields. When defeated, they may be claimed by the victor and added to their deck.
The game space is made up of Fields. Each duel takes place in a field, and units can use the battle phase on their turn to declare movement between fields instead of battling. Movement is resolved at the end of each turn. When opposed controllers occupy the same field, they must duel. Once all opposed units have been removed from the field (fled or destroyed), the opposed controller is defeated and the duel ends. A controller provides no draw phase for being defeated more than once in the same run (if they flee and are encountered again).
Field tokens remain on the field they are summoned to, and equip tokens move with the unit they are attached to. Tokens with no controller may be claimed by any controller during their turn. Fields may contain enemy controllers, neutral or friendly controllers, draw points, and pre-existing field and equip tokens.

Voting Format: Shorthand for Power is P and Energy Token is E (2P Soldier, single-1E). When voting, place any costs in [] brackets. Stick to a format of "'source' 'effect' 'target' [cost]", such as "2P Soldier uses Destroy on 3P Dragon [double-2E]" or "Destroy 3P Dragon [double-2E]" if the source isn't needed, or "2P Soldier Power +1 [single-5E]" if the target isn't needed.
