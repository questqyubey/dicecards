This game is designed to evoke the feeling of TCG games like “Magic The Gathering” and “YuGiOh!” using a dice-based system. Players take turns to draw & roll dice, summon units, and battle each other. The first player to be damaged directly, or to start their turn with no dice in stock, loses the game.

## Concepts

**Setup:** Each player needs 27 dice in 1-4 colours (at least 9 white, recomm. 6 for each colour), and chooses up to 9 abilities for their deck, to be split into 3 'archetypes' each with a unique colour. An archetype’s colour indicates which units and tokens belong to it. White dice indicate typeless units and tokens.

**Dice & Units:** Dice are your resources and your units. In the hand, they can be spent to summon units and charge energy. On the field, they represent units and tokens. You start with 24 in stock to draw from and 3 'shield' dice to protect you. Once a die is spent or a unit destroyed, it is discarded.

**Placing Dice:** If an ability or an action requires dice to be placed, use dice that were discarded as part of the cost. Otherwise, take dice from the player's stock. You can swap out dice of the appropriate colour from the grave or stock as needed but keep the same total count.

**Discard & Banish:** When dice are discarded, add them to the player's grave. When dice are banished, they are removed from play.

**Fractions:** All fractions are rounded up.

## Elements of Play

**Stock:** A pool of 24 dice that players can draw from. If a player starts their turn with 0 dice in stock, they lose. Dice in the stock are typeless.

**Hand:** A private pool of dice, drawn from the stock. Each die has a value which is rolled when drawn. They are spent to summon units or charge energy tokens. Players discard down to 6 dice during the End Phase. Dice in the hand are typeless.

**Grave:** A pool of dice that have been spent or discarded. Dice in the grave are typeless.

**Units:** Placed by summoning a hand die for half its value. A player can have up to five units on their field. Each unit has a Power rating, indicated by the value of its die, and an Archetype, indicated by the die's colour. For units with >6 power, stack up to 3 dice with 6 power each (18 power max). If a unit would be placed when a player already has five on their field, discard it.

**Damage:** When units battle they deal their power in damage to each other simultaneously. Damage does not reduce a unit’s power. If the damage dealt to a unit during a single turn is equal to or greater than their power, they are destroyed. If a unit is ever reduced to 0 power, they are destroyed and their dice discarded.

**Energy Tokens:** Placed by charging a hand die for its full value. Sets of matching values can be spent to activate unit abilities. Energy tokens are typeless. After energy tokens are spent, discard them.

**Shields:** Each player has 3 Shield Dice, valued at 2, 4, and 6 (outer to inner). A player cannot be targeted while they have shields, and only the outermost shield can be targeted. Shield dice are typeless and cannot attack. Damage dealt to a Shield reduces its power, and at 0 power it is destroyed. Destroyed shield dice are rolled and added to the player's hand. When the player has no more shields, they can be targeted directly.

**Abilities:** Archetypes have abilities and units can activate them during a Main Phase by paying their cost. Once paid, the effect activates and targets may be selected.

- 'Single', any one energy token.
- 'Double', two matching energy tokens.
- 'Triple', three matching energy tokens.
- 'Low', energy token/s with 1, 2 or 3.
- 'High', energy token/s with 4, 5, or 6.

**Other Tokens:** Tokens are represented by dice. A token's archetype is indicated by its die colour and the die's value corresponds to the ability used to create them (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Stacking tokens sums the effects, but they only trigger once and don't add more targets (ie: two +1s become +2, on-battle only triggers once).

- Equip tokens affect units they are equipped to, and are placed to the left and right of the unit (max 2 kinds per unit, stackable to 3). When a unit is destroyed, their equip tokens are destroyed as well. An equip token shares the same controller as its attached unit, or belongs to its original owner.

- Field tokens affect the whole field, and are placed to the far left of all units (unlimited kinds, stackable to 3). Field tokens are controlled by their original owner.

## Turn Structure

**Turn Phases:** Players take turns in the duel, and the challenged player always goes first. The turns progress as follows:

- Draw Phase
- Main Phase 1
- Battle Phase
- Main Phase 2
- End Phase

The player to go first skips their first Battle Phase. The player to go second draws +1 dice on their first turn.

**Draw Phase:** The player draws 3 dice from the stock, rolls them, and adds them to their hand. Keep the values hidden.

**Main Phase:** Hand dice can be used to summon units (power = half die value, archetype = 1 from deck), or charged as energy tokens (full die value). Energy can be spent to activate abilities. Each turn, players have 1 summon action and 2 charge actions.

**Battle Phase:** The player can declare their units as attackers, then the opponent declares units as defenders. The defender chooses the order of battles with units, and the attacker chooses the order of battles with shields. Each defender can only block one attacker, but multiple defenders may block the same attacker. If an attacker isn't defended against, it attacks the opponent's shields, or the opponent directly if there are no shields.

**End Phase:** Discard down to 6 hand dice and resolve end-of-turn effects.
