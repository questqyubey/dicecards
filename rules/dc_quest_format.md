## Dice Cards Quest Rules

The following are rules included for the quest format. Uses all the rules from dc_soul_master.

## Attributes

**Rarity:** Abilities and Archetypes are rated ‚ú¶ Common, ‚òÖ Uncommon, and ‚ú∂ Rare. Abilities are rated according to the effects that they have, and Archetypes inherit the highest rarity from their abilities.

- Soul Cards have a rarity of ‚çü Soul Card, and a rarity of üåô Exotic can be used for unusual or unique abilities.

**Money:** Paks are an abstract unit of currency in the Soul Master setting. They represent the cost to buy a single basic booster pack of 5 cards with 1 guaranteed higher rarity. In Dice Cards, an Archetype roughly represents 15-20 cards, so the cost for an Archetype is abstracted to 5 Paks.

**Duel Energy**: Duel energy is used to fuel scion abilities and creations. A duel grants duel energy to both sides equal to half the number of turns taken, rounded up (average 2-3). A soul duel grants an additional +1 energy to each side. A human or a Relic can store 3 Soul Energy, and a Realm can store 6 Soul Energy. Legacies can store 15 Soul Energy. A single person can only hold 18 Soul Energy.

## Play

**Quest Campaign:** Players follow a narrative adventure and participate in a streamlined deckbuilding game. Abilities are not managed individually and instead only archetypes are managed.

Abilites are split into individual booster sets, which each contain between 10-20 abilities sharing a set of core keywords and 3-5 set-specific keywords. Each set should contain around 50% common, 30% uncommon, and 20% rare, with premium boosters containing more uncommons and rares.

A booster costs $5 per ability, and each ability rolls a random rarity, then a random ability from the set in that rarity. Archetypes can be sold for bounties for Rarity & Keyword content (ie, Rare Archetype with Piercing).

- If using Tribes, give each set 1 or more Tribes and randomly determine the tribe when buying the booster. Archetypes with similar tribes can be merged, but must discard down to 3 abilities max. Tribes can be part of the bounty requirement.
- If using Soul Cards, each ability in the booster gives a 5% chance to instead be a Soul Card (max 15%). The Soul Card gains all the abilities that would be in the booster, but cannot be merged with an Archetype. Their individual abilities can be Extracted out to a new Archetype that shares their Tribe.
- Other duelists will have certain sets associated with them, and winning against a duelist gives you a booster from one of their sets. The amount of abilities in the booster depends on the amount of abilities they used: up to 3 gives 1 Ability, up to 6 gives 2 Abilities, and up to 9 includes 3 Abilities. Soul Card abilities are included in this count.

**Scion Powers:** Players can choose to play as normal or to be one of the five Scion types from Soul Master. Their powers cannot be used inside of a duel and instead focus on narrative play and deckbuilding. Their powers take Duel Energy to use.

- _Crucible: (6)_ Sacrifice up to 3 abilities and produce 1 that combines them. Takes effects, cost type, keywords, and triggers. Card can be overturned or banned by a Judge.

- _Balance: (3)_ Re-write the cost of an ability. If increased, ability grows stronger, and vice versa. Cost can be changed between charge sets, unit power, grave dice, unit sacrifice, etc.
- _Ruling: (6)_ Create an rule card that can be used to enforce special rules in a duel. Card must be recharged with 3 energy per use. Rule takes the form of a field ability that cannot be removed and affects both sides. Cost of effect is unlimited. Card can be overturned or banned by a Judge.

**Soul:** Masters of spirit.

- _Ritual: (1)_ Can create Ritual abilities.
- _Delving: (1)_ Enter the soul of another creature. Subject must be willing or unconscious. Soul realm acts like a deck realm. Provides details on that person's personality, interests, and possible carded form. Extended time spent inside will cause bleeding of emotions and memories into the delver.
- _Mimicry: (1)_ Person can embody an Archetype, Soul Card, or person. Appears to be that unit or object to all observers, and can cast its abilities inside a soul realm. Biomes inherently see the unit as being that archetype or person. Outside a soul realm it lasts a few hours, inside a soul realm it is indefinite.
- _Tear: (4, 8)_ Creates a localized Soul Realm. Area acts like a Soul Realm for a short period of time. At higher power, rift is stablized and lasts for a week. Can be upkept with 2 energy per week. Allows cards to be summoned and scion charms to manifest by using the tear's energy. Can be built into a Soul Club or a Biome with other scion assistance.
- _Sealing: (3 to seal, 12 to unseal)_ Seal a living soul into a card and release duel energy, or expend duel energy and release the soul trapped inside a card. Carded soul reverts to their human state as much as possible. Individual must be willing or lose willpower (does not include sleep). Sealing objects or animals produces an Archetype with abilities instead.
