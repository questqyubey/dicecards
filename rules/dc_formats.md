## Dice Cards Soul Master Rules

The following are extra rules for expanding duel and narrative play.

## Attributes

**Rarity:** Abilities and Archetypes are rated ‚ú¶ Common, ‚òÖ Uncommon, and ‚ú∂ Rare. Abilities are rated according to the effects that they have, and Archetypes inherit the highest rarity from their abilities.

- Soul Cards have a rarity of ‚çü Soul Card, and a rarity of üåô Exotic can be used for unusual or unique abilities.

## Formats

**Drafting:** Players construct decks of up to 3 archetypes with 3 abilities each (9 total), from randomized sets. There should be at least 3 sets per player. Each pack should include 3 Common abilities, 2 Uncommon abilities, and 1 Rare ability. Players take turns to choose one ability from their sets, and then pass the remainder to the next player.

- If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it to one ability from the pack. Players set the tribes of their archetypes.

**Campaign:** Players construct their own decks through dueling and deckbuilding. Abilities are earnt from winning duels or bought from a store. Abilities can be bought and sold by rarity: Common $1, Uncommon $2, Rare $5. A pack of 3 random abilities can be bought for $5 (limit 1 rare per pack). Abilities can be used to create a new archetype or added to an existing archetype. Abilities cannot be switched between archetypes once assigned and can only be removed by selling them. Archetypes can be combined if they share the same Tribe, but must discard down to 3 abilities. Players start with $5.

- If using Soul Cards, each pack has a 1 in 6 chance to contain a soul card. Randomly assign it one ability from the pack. Abilities can be added to Soul Cards as per archetypes. Once a Soul Card is added to an archetype, it cannot change archetype. It will inherit the new archetype when combining.

- **Optional:** Soul Cards ability slots are unlocked by summoning them in duels. 1st slot is unlocked after 2 duels, 2nd after 4 duels, and 3rd after 6 duels. Duel count may be substituted by narrative events, if applicable.

**Quest Campaign:** Players follow a narrative adventure and participate in a streamlined deckbuilding game. Abilities are not managed individually and instead only archetypes are managed. Abilites are split into individual booster sets, which each contain between 10-20 abilities sharing a set of core keywords and 3-5 set-specific keywords. Each set should contain around 50% common, 30% uncommon, and 20% rare, with premium boosters containing more uncommons and rares. A booster costs $5 per ability, and each ability rolls a random rarity, then a random ability from the set in that rarity. Archetypes can be sold for bounties for Rarity & Keyword content (ie, Rare Archetype with Piercing).

- If using Tribes, give each set 1 or more Tribes and randomly determine the tribe when buying the booster. Archetypes with similar tribes can be merged, but must discard down to 3 abilities max. Tribes can be part of the bounty requirement.
- If using Soul Cards, each ability in the booster gives a 5% chance to instead be a Soul Card (max 15%). The Soul Card gains all the abilities that would be in the booster, but cannot be merged with an Archetype. Their individual abilities can be Extracted out to a new Archetype that shares their Tribe.
- Other duelists will have certain sets associated with them, and winning against a duelist gives you a booster from one of their sets. The amount of abilities in the booster depends on the amount of abilities they used: up to 3 gives 1 Ability, up to 6 gives 2 Abilities, and up to 9 includes 3 Abilities. Soul Card abilities are included in this count.

**Dungeon-Crawl:** Each player is represented by a 1-power 'Duelist' unit with no archetype that acts like a player. Duelists start with a stock (24), grave (0), and shield dice (3). They can be declared for battle during the battle phase, and all damage and effects are re-targeted to the outermost shield first. Abilities and damage may bypass shields if the duelist allows it. Duelists are defeated when they reach 0 stock or they are destroyed. Duelists start play with a draw phase but skip all other draw phases. Instead, they gain a draw phase for their next turn for each controller they defeat, or by finding a Draw point.

A controller is a unit or group of units that acts like a player. They have no stock, grave, or shield, but may control other units and tokens, and activate abilities. They may be encountered during play and defeated to gain a draw phase. Soul units and other unique units can be 'Duelist' units like the player is, and have their own stock, grave, and shields. When defeated, they may be claimed by the victor and added to their deck.

The game space is made up of Fields. Each duel takes place in a field, and units can use the battle phase on their turn to declare movement between fields instead of battling. Movement is resolved at the end of each turn. When opposed controllers occupy the same field, they must duel. Once all opposed units have been removed from the field (fled or destroyed), the opposed controller is defeated and the duel ends. A controller provides no draw phase for being defeated more than once in the same run (if they flee and are encountered again).

Field tokens remain on the field they are summoned to, and equip tokens move with the unit they are attached to. Tokens with no controller may be claimed by any controller during their turn. Fields may contain enemy controllers, neutral or friendly controllers, draw points, and pre-existing field and equip tokens.

**Roguelike Run**: TBD

## Quest-Specific

Shorthand for Power is P and Energy Token is E (2P Soldier, single-1E).

**Turn Options:** Place any costs in [] brackets. Votes are given in format of: _Source effect target [cost]_

- "2P Soldier uses Destroy on 3P Dragon [double-2E]"
- "Destroy 3P Dragon [double-2E]" if the source isn't needed
- "2P Soldier +1 Power [single-5E]" if the target isn't needed.
