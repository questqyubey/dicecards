Core Rules

This quest uses a dice-based game system designed to invoke the feeling of competitive card battle games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and Cardfight: Vanguard.

Each game is a duel between players that take turns to gather and spend dice in order to summon magical units, activate powerful abilities, and defeat the enemy. Before each duel, a player assembles a set of unique abilities to form an Archetype. The player can then summon units of this archetype that can use the abilities of it. Each turn a player will take 3 dice from their stock and roll them to determine their value. These dice can then be spent to summon units from the player's archetypes, or to charge up as energy tokens that activate a unit's abilities. These units are used to battle your enemy's units and destroy the shields protecting them. The first to damage the enemy player directly wins the duel.

Winning a duel will allow you to earn new abilities to construct decks with and shards to purchase rare abilities from shops. No deck is perfect and each has their strengths and weaknesses. You can swap out archetypes and build new strategies at any time, both to discover exciting new stategies and to outfox your opponents. There's a lot to discover and countless combinations to try.

Above all, have fun dueling out there!

------

Duels

A duel is commonly played between two players, each with their own deck of up to 3 archetypes. Each side takes turn to place units and energy, activate abilities, and battle each other. To win, you must damage your opponent directly. Each player has three shields protecting them, with the values 2, 3, and 6. These must be destroyed before a player can be targeted. Before the duel begins players must determine who goes first. Usually the one who initiated the duel goes first but players may roll dice to decide which player goes first.

Each player starts their turn with the Draw Phase, where they draw 3 dice from their Stock; a pool of 24 dice. They will roll these dice privately and add them to their hand. The player that goes second will draw an additional die on their first turn.

After this comes the Main Phase, where they can spend dice to summon units and to 'charge' energy tokens onto the field. Dice will often be placed to represent units and tokens on the field, and remind the players what is on the field. Any spent or discarded dice are placed in the Grave; a pool of discarded dice. If dice are 'banished' then they are removed from play entirely. Units on the field may also be used to activate powerful abilities by spending the cost, often using charged energy tokens.

Players can then move to the Battle Phase, where units can be used to battle their enemies, destroy the opponent's shields, and attack the opposing player. The player to go first skips the battle phase of their first turn. Once all battles are complete, players may take continue taking Main Phase actions until they are done, and clean up in their End Phase.

Once a player has done all they wish to with their turn they must resolve any ongoing effects in their End Phase and pass the turn to the other player. At the end of the turn if the player has more than 6 dice in their hand they must discard dice down to this hand limit. At the start of the turn if the player cannot draw any dice from their stock they lose the duel.

Players continue taking turns until either one player damages the other directly, or a player takes their Draw Phase with 0 dice in their stock.

Archetypes

The core of the game lies with constructing a deck of strong abilities, which are grouped into Archetypes. These archetypes provide you with the ability to summon units and activate abilities during a duel. Archetypes are started with a single, inital ability which defines the thematics of the archetype, such as what its units and tokens look like (like dragons or undead). Each archetype can only hold up to 3 total abilities which can be freely swapped out.

The abilities represent magic, technology, and effects that can be activated by, or apply to, the units of the archetype. Thematically, activating an ability may represent the unit itself using an innate power, or the duelist augmenting them with some kind of magic or equipment. A unit that is 'typeless' possesses no abilities, and is considered a 'generic' unit.

To activate an ability of an archetype you must control a unit with the given type and meet any costs specified by the ability. Abilities may also specify conditions that must be met before activation. See the Abilities section for more details.

On the field, units and tokens are represented by coloured dice; the colour of which represents their current archetype. A unit can only display one type, ie. one colour, but effects may apply more archetypes to a given unit without changing the colour. White dice represent that the unit is Typeless and has no associated abilities.

If the unit consists of multiple dice, the top-most die's colour determines their type. If a unit's type is changed, replace the unit's top-most die with one of the appropriate colour. Dice in the stock, hand, and grave are considered typeless, regardless of the die's actual colour. When placing a die on the field, you may swap the die itself out for a die of the appropriate colour, even from your stock or grave. Ensure both pools maintain the same count of dice when doing this to avoid messing with the totals.

------

Units

Units are the individual creatures and creations that you command throughout the course of a duel. Each unit has an archetype, which determines what abilities they can use, and a Power rating, representing both the unit's attack power and health.

A unit is represented on the field by one or more dice. These dice are set with the Power rating of the unit facing up or, if the rating exceeds 6, stacked with each die below the top-most die representing a value of 6. A unit's base power rating cannot exceed 18, or three stacked dice (three 6s), but may be boosted with effects or abilities.

If a unit would be reduced to an base power rating of 0 or below, the unit is destroyed and their dice are discarded to the grave. Unless specified, any equip tokens the unit has will also be destroyed (see Tokens section).

Units may be summoned to the field under a player's command by spending a die from their hand. Players have 1 summon action per turn to use, but additional summon actions and unit placement (set a units) may be granted by abilities. Units with special summoning abilities, such as Ritual summoning, may require the player to pay additional costs in order to set the unit, such as discarding dice from the hand.

After a summon is paid for, the player will set one or more of the dice spent as part of the summoning cost onto the field. The die is set with a colour matching an archetype in the player's deck and a Power rating equal to HALF that of the value of the hand die spent (rounded up). Any dice discarded for special summoning do not count towards the value of a summon.

Up to 5 units can be set on each player's field. If a unit were to be set on a field where there are already 5 units, that player must choose to either discard one of their existing units or ignore the summoning. Each unit summoned is abstract and may appear to be anything appropriate to the archetype, such as undead, soldier, dragon, etc.

Some abilities may cause a unit to be captured, in which case the unit will be repositioned behind their 'captor' unit. Captured units can't be declared for battle, but may still activate abilities and be targeted by them. They retain their original owner and any equip tokens they had as well. Only one unit may be the captive of a given unit at a time, and captured units cannot capture other units. If the captor dies, the captured unit returns to their owner's field.

------

Battles

In the Battle Phase units may be used to attack your enemies. To battle, declare a number of your units for your side as attackers, after which the targeted player will select any units of their own as defenders to respond. Each defender can choose 1 attacker to battle, but multiple may battle a single attacker one after the other.

If an attacker is not met by a defender they will attack the foremost shield of the opponent. If there are no shields the player will be targeted instead. The order of resolution for battles between units are determined by the defender, and battles against shields are determined by the attacker. If multiple units are defending against a single attacker, the defender chooses the order of battle.

When one unit battles another, they attack each other simultaneously. Attacks deal an amount of damage to the target equal to the unit's Power rating. Damage dealt to a unit doesn't affect the power rating itself. If the total damage dealt to a unit during a turn is greater than or equal to the target's Power rating, the unit is destroyed. At the end of a turn, all units reset to no damage.

If two units with the same Power rating battle, they will deal equal damage and destroy one another. If a unit has the ability to strike first, their attack will take priority in the battle and their damage will be resolved first. If this would destroy the other unit, they won't be dealt damage by the other unit. Damage may also be caused by abilities outside of battles.

------

Abilities

Abilities are the special powers that units may activate to overcome opponents and execute strategies. Each archetype has a number of abilities; up to 3 each. To activate an ability you must control a unit with a matching archetype (called the caster) then pay any costs the ability requires. The cost must be paid before activation can occur. If the ability specifies conditions for activation, those must also be met before you can activate the ability.

The most common cost of abilities are sets of 'charged' energy tokens: Single, which is any single energy token; Doubles, which is a set of two energy tokens with matching values; and Triples, which is a set of three energy tokens all with matching values. In addition, High specifies the energy token must have a value of 4, 5, or 6, and Low specifies the token must have a value of 1, 2, or 3. A Flush is a run of six energy tokens with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Abilities will detail their effects, such as summoning additional units, removing units or tokens, or altering the state of the game. If you spend energy tokens to activate an ability, those tokens are placed in the grave after activation.

Some abilities may be 'equipped' to a unit or alter the field with an on-going effect. These are signified by placing a colour-typed die as a token with a value equal to the number of the ability, as a reminder of what it represents (1,2,3 on the archetype). The token is placed either next to the related unit as an equip token, or in the field zone as a field token (see Tokens).

If a die would be placed as a result of an ability, use dice from those spent (such as energy tokens) as the die to be placed. If not enough dice are spent for the placement, use dice from your stock instead. Make sure the dice placed matches the colour of the archetype, if applicable.

Abilities may sometimes require additional costs to activate, such as discarding dice from the hand, banishing dice from the grave, reducing power from your units or shields, destroying your own units (sacrifice), or requiring specific conditions for activation. Special summon abilities will modify the summoning costs or conditions of their archetype as well. These abilities are typically more powerful than regular ones.

Ritual abilities require you to pay additional costs before a unit can be set. Fusion abilities are similar but when the unit is set it adds the power and gains the equip tokens of any units sacrificed as part of the summoning cost. Realm abilities cause any units set to be replaced with a field token instead. Relic abilities are similar but require you to place an equip token instead of a unit. See Tokens for more details.

Shield Dice

At the start of a duel each duelist will have three Shield dice to protect them. These shields cannot attack but do have a power rating. They are valued at 2, 4, and 6 respectively, from foremost to inner-most. Each shield can have a maximum of 6 power. If a player has no units to defend them from battle their shields will act as defenders, starting from the foremost die.

Any damage dealt to a shield will decrease its power rating an equal amount to the damage dealt, and at 0 power or below the shield will be destroyed. When a shield die is destroyed, its die is rolled and added to the owner's hand as if they had drawn it from the stock. If an ability would directly target the player their foremost shield will be targeted instead.

------

Tokens

Tokens are dice that represent things that are not units or shields. If the effect of a token specifies 'until end of turn' or 'until your next turn' the token is destroyed after that event. There are a few kinds of tokens:

Energy Tokens are represented by dice placed in the charge zone, behind your units. These represent energy that is 'charged' for use, or spells ready to go off. When placed, they are typeless and have a value equal to the die spent. These tokens can be spent to pay the cost of activating abilities.

Equip Tokens are represented by dice placed in the unit zone, in the centre of the board. These represent ongoing effects and attachments applied to a specific unit. Each unit has 2 slots to place equip tokens in; one to the left of the unit and one to the right. A new token cannot be equipped to a unit if they already have both slots filled. Some equip effects may be cumulative and stacked up to three times, represented by placing dice with the same value atop one another.

Field Tokens are represented by dice placed in the field zone, to the left of the owner's units. These represent ongoing effects or features applied to the duel, affecting any numbers of players or units. Each player can place any number of field tokens. Unless stated, their effects are NOT cumulative and multiple will act as if only one was in play.

Relic Tokens are special equip tokens that replace units for archetypes with a Relic ability. Relic tokens always have Persistent and are not destroyed when their host unit is. They may be equipped to any unit each turn, including the turn they were summoned, and when unequipped they are controlled by the player that owns their archetype. Relic tokens are set with a value equal to the ability used to summon them (such as 1, 2, or 3). The value of the die used to summon them is ignored. A player can activate any regular, ritual, or fusion ability of the relic's archetype so long as they control a relic token of its type. If an archetype has multiple relic abilities, each relic ability must have its own referenced token in order to be activated.

Realm Tokens are special field tokens that replace units for archetypes with a Realm ability. Realm tokens are set with a value equal to the ability used to summon them (such as 1, 2, or 3). The value of the die used to summon them is ignored. You can activate any regular ability of the realm's archetype so long as you control a realm token of its type. If an archetype has multiple realm abilities, each realm ability must have its own referenced token in order to be activated.
