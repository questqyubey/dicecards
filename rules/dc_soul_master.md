## Dice Cards Soul Master Rules

The following are extra rules for the Soul Master setting.

## Attributes

**Soul Cards:** Special units with extra abilities. A deck can have 1 per archetype. They can be summoned as a soul unit by spending a die value equal to their soul value (1-6) as part of their summon cost. A soul card has 3 extra abilities (4th, 5th, 6th), in addition to their base archetype. Only one unit per soul card can be active on the field at a time.

**Tribes:** Archetypes have one of five tribes: Dark, Wild, Terra, Justice, Machine. All units and tokens inherit the tribe of their archetype. Effects may target tribes to affect multiple units and tokens at once.

## Summon Keywords

These keywords modify the units produced by an archetype. Archetypes can have multiple special keyword abilities, detailed below.

üó°Ô∏è
**Ritual:** An ability containing the Ritual keyword. They allow the use of more powerful passive effects. To summon a Ritual unit, all ritual costs must be paid.

üß¨
**Fusion:** An ability containing the Fusion keyword. They allow the use of more powerful units. To summon a Fusion unit, units from specified archetypes must be sacrificed. Units paid as part of the cost add their power and equip tokens to the new unit.

- If soul unit/s are paid as part of the cost, the new unit inherits 1 of their soul cards. If the Fusion ability itself is part of a soul card (not base archetype), the new unit always uses that soul card.

‚õ∞Ô∏è
**Realm:** An ability containing the Realm keyword. They allow the use of powerful, field-wide abilities. Instead of setting a unit, set a field token with Hexproof and value set to the Realm ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Realm abilities can only be activated by a Realm token with their value. They are placed in their owner's token zone but their abilities may affect the entire field.

üíç
**Relic:** An ability containing the Relic keyword. They allow the use of powerful unit-specific effects. Instead of setting a unit, set an equip token with Persistent and value set to the Relic ability. This token can activate regular abilities as per a unit. Relic abilities can only be activated by a Relic token with their value. The token can be re-equipped once per turn to any unit.

**Multiple:** If an archetype has multiple special keywords, all of their costs must be met to summon them and the conditions are cumulative. Fusion and Ritual abilities can be cast if you control a Relic or Realm token for the archetype. Casting Relic or Realm abilities require you to control a token that references the ability. If an archetype has a Relic or Realm ability, they are always set instead of a unit. If an archetype has both, either may be summoned by choice.
