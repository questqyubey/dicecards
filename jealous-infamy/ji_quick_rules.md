# Jealous Infamy: Soul Master - Quick Rules

_The following are quick-start rules for the duels in Jealous Infamy. They're intended for new players that want to get up to speed on what duels are and how to participate._

The dueling game is designed to evoke the feeling of a CCG, but by using six-sided **Dice** (d6s) instead of a deck of cards. In place of drawing cards from a deck, you take and roll dice from your **Stock** (of 24). When you draw dice, you add them to your hand and their rolled values determine what you can spend them on. Each turn you can use your hand dice to **Summon** 1 time and **Charge** 2 times, and at the end of the turn you discard down to 6 dice in the hand.

Each player has a 'deck' consisting of 3 **Archetypes**, which are an abstraction for groups of related cards; like Red Warriors in MtG, or RedEyes in YuGiOh. By spending a die from the hand you can summon a **Unit** in the archetype, and that unit can activate **Tactics** the archetype has - just like effects on a CCG card. A unit's identity is abstract and meant to evoke the archetype as a whole.

Each unit has a **Power** stat that indicates their health and damage in combat. A unit's power is equal to half the die used to summon it (rounded up). When units **Battle**, they deal damage to each other equal to their power, and if the damage meets or exceeds their own power, they die. A unit can also die by having their power reduced to 0 by effects.

**Tactics** are the special abilities on archetypes, which you pay for with **Energy** dice. Dice in the hand can be **Charged** into energy by placing them in the energy zone. Energy dice have a value equal to the die used to charge it. Each tactic will specify what value of energy die needs to be spent to activate it:

- 'Single', one energy value.
- 'Double', two matching energy values.
- 'Triple', three matching energy values.
- 'Low', energy value/s with 1, 2 or 3.
- 'High', energy value/s with 4, 5, or 6.

So a "Low Single" requires spending an Energy with value 1, 2, or 3, whereas just a "Single" could be any energy die. A "High Triple" requires a set of three 4s, 5s, or 6s and is difficult to set up. Other costs exist as well, such as sacrificing units, and certain triggering conditions, such as when a unit battles.

To **win** a duel, you have to destroy the opponent's three **Shield** dice and strike them directly, or force your opponent to draw when they have no dice left in stock (mill out). Most duels run around 4 turns so the game plays quick.

I hope this clears things up a bit, happy dueling!
