The following is the core rules to the duel game for Jealous Infamy: Soul Master. It is designed to evoke the feeling of CCG games like “Magic The Gathering”, “YuGiOh!”, and "Duel Masters, in a streamlined manner designed for physical play and rapid deck building. It is inspired by the Soul Master series of stores on Fiction.live created by Brop.

In place of cards, all elements of the game are represented by six-sided _Dice_ (d6s), with a face value often representing a power or value. In the game, players take turns to draw dice from their stock, and then spend them to play powerful _Units_ and _Tactics_ to crush the opposition. The first player to be damaged directly, or to start their turn with no dice left in their stock, loses the game. Each player assembles their own customized deck which is split into _Archetypes_, which abstract the many cards of a traditional CCG.

## Concepts

**Setup:** Each player needs 27 dice in 1-4 colours (at least 9 white, recomm. 6 for each colour). Each player assembles a deck of three Archetypes, each of which have 3 Tactic abilities and a unique die colour. An archetype’s colour indicates which units and tokens belong to it. White dice indicate typeless units and tokens.

**Dice & Units:** Dice represent your resources and playing pieces. You start with a Stock of 24 which are drawn to the Hand. Hand dice can then be spent to summon Units by placing them on the unit zone, or to charge Energy by placing them in the charge zone. You have 3 Shield Dice which protect you from attacks by units. Once a die is spent, or a unit or token is destroyed, it is discarded to the Grave.

**Placing Dice:** If an action requires dice be placed, use dice that were spent as part of the cost first. Otherwise, use dice from the player's stock instead. You can swap out dice of the appropriate colour from the grave or stock as needed but make sure to keep the same total count.

**Discard & Banish:** When dice are discarded, they are added to that player's grave. When dice are banished, they are removed from play.

**Fractions:** All fractions are rounded up.

## Elements of Play

**Stock:** A pool of 24 dice that players can draw from. If a player starts their turn with 0 dice in stock, they lose. Dice in the stock are typeless.

**Hand:** A private pool of dice, drawn from the stock. Each die has a value which is rolled when drawn. They are spent to summon units or charge energy tokens. Players discard down to 6 dice during the End Phase. Dice in the hand are typeless.

**Grave:** A pool of dice that have been spent or discarded. Dice in the grave are typeless.

**Units:** Summoned by spending a hand die and placing it at half its value. A player can have up to five units on their field. Each unit has a Power rating, indicated by the value of its die, and an Archetype, indicated by the die's colour. For units with >6 power, stack up to 3 dice with 6 power each (18 power max). If a unit would be placed when a player already has five on their field, discard it.

**Damage:** When units battle they deal an amount of damage damage, equal to their power, to each other simultaneously. Damage does not reduce a unit’s power. If the damage dealt to a unit during a single turn is equal to or greater than their power, they are destroyed. If a unit is ever reduced to 0 power, they are destroyed.

**Shields:** Each player has 3 Shield Dice, with power 2, 4, and 6 (outer to inner). A player cannot be targeted while they have shields, and only the outermost shield can be targeted. Shield dice are typeless and cannot attack. Damage dealt to a Shield reduces its power, and at 0 power it is destroyed. A destroyed shield die is rolled and added to the player's hand as if it were drawn from the stock. When the player has no more shields, they can be targeted directly.

**Energy:** Tokens placed by charging a hand die and placing it at full value. These can be spent to activate unit tactics and may require matching sets to activate. Energy tokens are typeless. After energy tokens are spent, they are discarded.

**Tactics:** Archetypes can have up to three tactics and units belonging to that archetype can activate any of them during a Main Phase by paying their cost. Once paid, the effect activates and targets may be selected.

- 'Single', one energy token.
- 'Double', two matching energy tokens.
- 'Triple', three matching energy tokens.
- 'Low', energy token/s with 1, 2 or 3.
- 'High', energy token/s with 4, 5, or 6.

**Tokens:** Any non-unit and non-shield piece on the board, including Energy. A token's archetype is indicated by its die colour and the die's value corresponds to the tactic used to create them (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Stacking tokens sums their effects, but they only trigger once and don't add more targets (ie: two +1s become +2, on-battle only triggers once).

**Attachments:** Special tokens which affect units they are attached to. They are placed to the left and right of their attached unit. A single unit can have up to two unique kinds of attachments, and they can stack their effects up to three tokens per kind. When a unit is destroyed, their attachments are destroyed as well. An attachment shares the same controller as its attached unit, or belongs to its original owner.

**Features:** Special tokens affect the entire field. They are placed to the far left of all units on their controller's side. There is no limit to the kinds of features that can exist on a field, but they can only stack their effects up to three tokens per kind. Field tokens are controlled by their original owner.

## Turn Structure

**Turn Phases:** Players take turns in the duel, and the challenged player always goes first. The turns progress as follows:

- Draw Phase
- Main Phase 1
- Battle Phase
- Main Phase 2
- End Phase

The player to go first skips their first Battle Phase. The player to go second draws +1 dice on their first turn.

**Draw Phase:** The player draws 3 dice from the stock, rolls them, and adds them to their hand. Keep the values hidden.

**Main Phase:** Hand dice can be used to summon units (power = half die value, archetype = 1 from deck), or charged as energy tokens (full die value). Energy can be spent to activate tactics. Each turn, players have 1 summon action and 2 charge actions.

**Battle Phase:** The player can declare their units as attackers, then the opponent declares units as defenders. The defender chooses the order of battles with units, and the attacker chooses the order of battles with shields. Each defender can only block one attacker, but multiple defenders may block the same attacker. If an attacker isn't defended against, it attacks the opponent's shields, or the opponent directly if there are no shields.

**End Phase:** Discard down to 6 hand dice and resolve end-of-turn effects.
