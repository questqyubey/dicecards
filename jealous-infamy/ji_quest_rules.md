## Jealous Infamy: Soul Master - Quest Rules

The following are rules that relate to deckbuilding and systems outside the duels.

## Attributes

**Scions:** A Scion is a human with access to magical powers that relate to the game of Soul Master. There are many different kinds of scions and they each specialize into their own field of magic. In Jealous Infamy, all scion magic is performed outside of duels and primarily involves deckbuilding and interacting with other duelists.

Scion magic can either be learnt by exploring the world, or be taught by other scions of a similar nature. Most scion powers require Duel Energy to activate, which can be earnt by dueling. This energy is stored inside souls or magical artefacts. Some spells and effects can be transferred to mundane people, but they cannot create them on their own.

**Money:** Paks are an abstract unit of currency in the Soul Master setting. They represent the cost to buy a single basic booster pack of 5 cards with 1 guaranteed higher rarity. In Dice Cards, an archetype roughly represents 15-20 cards, so the cost for an archetype is abstracted to 5 Paks per tactic.

**Duel Energy**: Duel energy is used to fuel scion powers and creations. A duel grants duel energy to both sides equal to half the number of turns taken, rounded up (average 2-3). A soul duel grants an additional +1 energy to each side. A human or a Relic can store 3 Soul Energy, and a Realm can store 6 Soul Energy. Legacies can store 15 Soul Energy. A single person can only hold 18 Soul Energy.

## Deckbuilding

Players build custom decks during the course of the quest by obtaining Starter Sets and Booster Packs. Starter Sets provide the baseline for a deck with two archetypes and four tactics that contribute to a general playstyle. Booster Packs provide one archetype and one tactic for every 5 Paks spent, to a maximum of 15. The tactics obtained are random but can be narrowed to a specific playstyle.

The setting of Jealous Infamy splits the majority of duelists into using 10 thematic packs, called Sets. Sets have a general playstyle, one or more Tribes, and certain keywords associated with them, which form the basis of Starter and Booster packs. As players progress and use scion powers they can customize their deck to their liking.

Players earn boosters by winning duels, purchasing them from stores, and going on jobs. When earning a booster from a duel, the amount of tactics earned will correspond to the complexity of the duelist's deck. Every 3 tactics in their deck, including from soul cards, provides 1 tactic in the earned booster. The set of the pack will match the deck they were using as well, or may be personalized for certain duelists.

Players can earn money by doing the same, but can also trade in their archetypes and soul cards for Bounties. A bounty will be set to require a certain set of attributes; such as a Tribe, a Set, keywords, and costs. The more complex the requirements, the greater the reward will be. Bounties can provide rare tactics in exchange as well.

Soul cards can be earnt by using a scion challenge spell on a duelist, where the ante of the duel is a minimum of one soul. This can either be the soul of the duelist or any soul cards they possess. Upon losing a duel, the soul card produced will reflect the deck that was used by the duelist. The amount of tactics a soul card knows depends on their loyalty to the duelist, which can be increased through discipline or bonding. Booster packs also have a 1% chance to be a soul card instead of a normal archetype.

## Asides

At some points in the quest, certain tactics and units may prove to be too high or low value for their cost, in both the player and NPC decks. Balancing will be a common occurance to try and improve these points as the game goes on. If a tactic or strategy is in use by the player and is rebalanced, the players may be refunded some money to replace the strategy if needed, or a replacement tactic may be offered.

Design is a never ending process so hopefully this provides some value back in exchange!
