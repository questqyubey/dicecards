## Jealous Infamy: Soul Master - Advanced Rules

The following are advanced rules that relate to specific elements of the system.

## Attributes

**Soul Cards:** An extension of an archetype with a unique unit. A deck can support one soul card per archetype. A soul card's unit, called a Soul Unit, can be summoned by spending a die value equal to their soul value (1-6) as part of their summon cost. A soul card has 3 extra tactics (4th, 5th, 6th) in addition to their base archetype that only the soul unit can activate. Only one unit per soul card can be active on the field at a time.

**Tribes:** Archetypes have one of five tribes: Dark, Wild, Terra, Justice, Machine. All units and tokens inherit the tribe of their archetype. Effects may target tribes to affect multiple units and tokens at once.

**Rarity:** Tactics and archetypes are rated ‚ú¶ Common, ‚òÖ Uncommon, and ‚ú∂ Rare. Tactics are rated according to the effects that they have, and archetypes inherit the highest rarity from their tactics.

- Soul Cards have a rarity of ‚çü Soul Card, and a rarity of üåô Exotic can be used for unusual or unique tactics.

## Summon Keywords

These keywords modify the units produced by an archetype. Archetypes can have multiple special keyword tactics, detailed below.

üó°Ô∏è
**Ritual:** An tactic containing the Ritual keyword. They allow the use of more powerful passive effects. To summon a Ritual unit, all ritual costs must be paid.

üß¨
**Fusion:** An tactic containing the Fusion keyword. They allow the use of more powerful units. To summon a Fusion unit, units from specified archetypes must be sacrificed. Units paid as part of the cost add their power and attachments to the new unit.

- If soul unit/s are paid as part of the cost, the fusion unit inherits a soul card from one of the sacrificed units. If the Fusion tactic itself is part of a soul card (not base archetype), the fusion unit always uses that soul card.

‚õ∞Ô∏è
**Realm:** An tactic containing the Realm keyword. They allow the use of powerful, field-wide tactics. Instead of setting a unit, set a feature with Shelter and value set to the Realm tactic. This token can activate regular tactics as per a unit. Realm tactics can only be activated by a Realm feature set to their value. They are placed in their owner's feature zone.

üíç
**Relic:** An tactic containing the Relic keyword. They allow the use of powerful unit-specific effects. Instead of setting a unit, set an attachment with Persistent and value set to the Relic tactic. This token can activate regular tactics as per a unit. Relic tactics can only be activated by a Relic attachment with their value. They can re-attach themselves once per turn even if they were already attached to a unit.

**Multiple:** If an archetype has multiple special keywords, all of their costs must be met to summon them and the conditions are cumulative. Fusion and Ritual tactics can be cast if you control a Relic or Realm token for the archetype. Casting Relic or Realm tactics require you to control a token that references the tactic. If an archetype has a Relic or Realm tactic, they are always set instead of a unit. If an archetype has both or multiple of the same, the player chooses which one to summon and what special ability it corresponds to.
